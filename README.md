# scRNA-seq analysis of GSE122873

Step 1. Download the dataset from "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" by entering query "GSE122873" 
We will download the expression matrix (the number of reads (UMIs) per gene, per cell after Cellranger processing and alignment to hg38)
the text files muscle biopsy-derived myocyte cultures from 2 FSHD1 patients, 2 FSHD2 patients and 2 healthy control individuals for is in "GSE122873_RAW".

Step 2. Run scRNA_FSHD_analysis.Rmd in Rstudio
